"Air pollution comes from a wide array of sources, both natural and caused by human activities (anthropogenic). Natural sources include volcanic eruptions, sea spray, soil dust, natural vegetation fires and lightning. Some of the most common human activity-related sources include power generation, transportation, industry, residential heating and cooking, agriculture, solvent use, oil and gas production, waste burning and construction. Some sources, such as forest and savanna fires, and windblown mineral dust, occur naturally, but are exacerbated by human activities.",
"Air pollution significantly impacts places near its source, but because it can be carried long distances in the atmosphere, air pollution created in one place, can also affect faraway places. For example, pollutants that form into fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and ozone (O 3 ) can travel over hundreds or thousands of kilometres, causing regional and continental impacts.",
"The air pollutant of greatest concern for human health, and for which there is the strongest evidence is fine particulate matter. This has a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, also known as PM 2.5 . These fine particles are invisible to the human eye and 40 times smaller than the width of a human hair.",
"Children are particularly vulnerable to the damaging health effects of air pollution due to their unique susceptibility and exposure: Children’s respiratory tracts are more permeable, their breathing rate is twice as much as adults, and they take in more air per kilogram (kg) of their body weight. Children’s bodies, especially their lungs and brains, are still developing, with narrower blood vessels.",
"While all individuals experience different levels of health impacts from air pollution, across large city or country populations, there is no evidence of a completely safe level of air pollution, especially in the case of particulate matter and NO 2 .",
"Some air pollutants cause ‘acid rain’, a problem that received particular focus in Europe and North America in the 1980s and 90s. Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react with water in the atmosphere, producing sulphuric acid and nitric acid that return to earth as acid rain.",
"Air pollution and climate change are inherently linked. All major air pollutants have an impact on the climate and most share common sources with greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially related to the combustion of fossil fuels. They also aggravate each other in multiple ways."

"Air is a mixture of gases that circle Earth, kept in place by gravity. Air makes up Earth’s atmosphere. The air we breathe is 78 percent nitrogen gas, 21 percent oxygen, 0.9 percent argon, and 0.03 percent carbon dioxide, along with water vapor.",
"Ozone, or three molecules of oxygen (O3, compared with the O2 that humans breathe), is a blanket in the atmosphere that covers Earth. The ozone layer is located between 9 and 25 miles (15 and 40 kilometers) up in the atmosphere, and it is produced by the interaction of the Sun’s radiation with certain air molecules.",
"Oxygen is necessary for all humans, animals, and plant life to survive. When Earth was first formed, its atmosphere had no oxygen—the colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that makes up about 20 percent of the air we breathe.",
"The white light of the Sun consists of many wavelengths. When seen separately, each wavelength corresponds with a different color. The air molecules and particles of matter that make up Earth’s atmosphere scatter some of the Sun’s light as it travels to Earth, especially the shorter wavelengths that give us the color blue.",
"A layer of air called the atmosphere surrounds Earth. The air within this layer moves from place to place when it warms up or cools down. This moving air is called wind. Winds move moisture and heat around the world, and they also produce much of our weather.",
"Antarctica is the coldest, highest, windiest, driest, and iciest continent on Earth. Winds can sometimes reach up to 200 miles (322 kilometers) per hour for five hours per day.",
"Clouds are formed from billions of minute water droplets and tiny ice crystals that float together in the sky. Each of the droplets in a cloud is about 100 times smaller than a raindrop.",
"Although the water and ice in clouds may typically weigh tons, the weight of a cloud is spread out over a very large area. The cloud’s droplets are also very small—about one-hundred-thousandth of an inch across. A cloud’s individual particles are so small, in fact, that warm air rising from Earth’s surface is able to keep them floating in the air.",
"Jets leave white trails, called contrails, in their paths for the same reason you can sometimes see your breath on a cold winter morning.",
"Rain clouds are generally dark gray because light cannot penetrate them due to the deep and densely packed water droplets and ice inside the cloud. Generally, the color of a cloud depends on the cloud’s relationship to the sunlight.",
"A rainbow is an arc that shows all the colors, with their different wavelengths, that make up visible light. Seven colors make up a rainbow, and they always appear in the same order: red, with the longest wavelength, is on the top, followed by orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo (a deep reddish-blue that is often difficult to see), and violet, which has the shortest wavelength.",
"In a large rain cloud, as water droplets bump into each other and increase in size, they become electrically charged. This activity causes electric charges on the ground, too.",
"As lightning flashes in the sky, it causes thunder. Light from the flash travels almost instantly to your eyes, but the sound of the thunder arrives a few seconds later.",
"A hurricane, which is also known as a tropical cyclone or a typhoon, is a massive storm in which a vast system of dark clouds, heavy rains, and strong winds circle around a calm center.",
"Tornadoes—violent, funnel-like storms of strong winds that usually form during thunderstorms—present danger to anyone nearby. These “twisters” can demolish anything in their path, including homes, people, cars, trees, animals, and even entire communities."
